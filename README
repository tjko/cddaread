CDDAread v1.4 for SGI   Copyright (c)  Timo Kokkonen, 1996-1998.


CD-DA to digital audio file conversion utility for SGI


TESTED PLATFORMS
	IRIX 5.3
	IRIX 6.2 
	IRIX 6.3 (since IRIX 6.3 supports mounting of cdda, probably no
	          much use for this program...)


INSTALLATION
        Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
        tar file. For example you could do this:

                zcat cddaread-1.4.tar.gz | tar xf -
                cd cddaread-1.4


	If you want to use the precompiled binary (mips-sgi-irix6.2)
	that (hopefully :) comes with the distribution, just type:

		./configure
		make install


	To compile the program yourself (highly recommended). You
	may want do something like this:

                ./configure
		make clean
                make
                make strip
                make install
