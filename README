CDDAread v1.4 for SGI   Copyright (c)  Timo Kokkonen, 1996-1998.


TESTED PLATFORMS
	IRIX 5.3
	IRIX 6.2 
	IRIX 6.3 (since IRIX 6.3 supports mounting of cdda, probably no
	          much use for this program...)


INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file. Type 'make install' if you want to use the precompiled
	binary. If you want to compile the program check the makefile,
	then type something like this 'make clean; make; make strip'.
	Test that the binary works and then type 'make install'.
